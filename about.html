            <h2>Interest and Hobbies:</h2>
            <p>I am interested in both back-end and front-end development, and one day hope to learn the whole stack. My plan is to learn more javascript to make my website more interactive. Once I have mastered javascript I hope to learn a suitable framework.</p>
            <p>Outside of programming I like to watch the St.Louis Cardinals, play golf, read, and excercise. During school I also work at a restaurant called Hoppers. I have been working in the restaurant industry for a while now so I have learned valuable skills from these experiences.</p>
